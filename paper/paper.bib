	abstract = {Human mathematical competence emerges from two representational systems. Competence in some domains of mathematics, such as calculus, relies on symbolic representations that are unique to humans who have undergone explicit teaching. More basic numerical intuitions are supported by an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system that is shared by adults, infants and non-human animals - these groups can all represent the approximate number of items in visual or auditory arrays without verbally counting, and use this capacity to guide everyday behaviour such as foraging. Despite the widespread nature of the approximate number system both across species and across development, it is not known whether some individuals have a more precise non-verbal 'number sense' than others. Furthermore, the extent to which this system interfaces with the formal, symbolic maths abilities that humans acquire by explicit instruction remains unknown. Here we show that there are large individual differences in the non-verbal approximation abilities of 14-year-old children, and that these individual differences in the present correlate with children's past scores on standardized maths achievement tests, extending all the way back to kindergarten. Moreover, this correlation remains significant when controlling for individual differences in other cognitive and performance factors. Our results show that individual differences in achievement in school mathematics are related to individual differences in the acuity of an evolutionarily ancient, unlearned approximate number sense. Further research will determine whether early differences in number sense acuity affect later maths learning, whether maths education enhances number sense acuity, and the extent to which tertiary factors can affect both. ©2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {People can direct their gaze at a visual target for extended periods of time. Yet, even during fixation the eyes make small, involuntary movements (e.g. tremor, drift, and microsaccades). This can be a problem during experiments that require stable fixation. The shape of a fixation target can be easily manipulated in the context of many experimental paradigms. Thus, from a purely methodological point of view, it would be good to know if there was a particular shape of a fixation target that minimizes involuntary eye movements during fixation, because this shape could then be used in experiments that require stable fixation. Based on this methodological motivation, the current experiments tested if the shape of a fixation target can be used to reduce eye movements during fixation. In two separate experiments subjects directed their gaze at a fixation target for 17s on each trial. The shape of the fixation target varied from trial to trial and was drawn from a set of seven shapes, the use of which has been frequently reported in the literature. To determine stability of fixation we computed spatial dispersion and microsaccade rate. We found that only a target shape which looks like a combination of bulls eye and cross hair resulted in combined low dispersion and microsaccade rate. We recommend the combination of bulls eye and cross hair as fixation target shape for experiments that require stable fixation.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Down syndrome ({DS}) exhibit various math difficulties which can be ascribed both to global intelligence level and/or to their atypical cognitive profile. In this light, it is crucial to investigate whether {DS} display deficits in basic numerical skills. In the present study, individuals with {DS} and two groups of typically developing ({TD}) children matched for mental and chronological age completed two delayed match-to-sample tasks in order to evaluate the functioning of visual enumeration skills. Children with {DS} showed a specific deficit in the discrimination of small numerosities (within the subitizing range) with respect to both mental and chronological age matched {TD} children. In contrast, the discrimination of larger numerosities, though lower than that of chronological age matched controls, was comparable to that of mental age matched controls. Finally, counting was less fluent but the understanding of cardinality seemed to be preserved in {DS}. These results suggest a deficit of the object tracking system underlying the parallel individuation of small numerosities and a typical - but developmentally delayed - acuity of the approximate number system for discrimination of larger numerosities.},

	abstract = {Response to Intervention ({RTI}) has been shown to be better at identifying and addressing learning difficulties than other frameworks. However, only a few educational systems have implemented it, and it can be difficult for schools to implement {RTI} on their own without policies in place. One solution is to create semi-automated digital tools that can assist with {RTI} without requiring a lot of extra time from the teacher. This study describes the development and implementation of such tools in schools that were not previously familiar with {RTI}. The effectiveness of the tools was tested by comparing 5 schools (149 students) that used {RTI} with 8 schools (269 students) that did not. The results showed that the extra practice was effective and that students in the intervention group made significantly more progress in arithmetic fluency than their peers in the control group. These students were also more likely to leave the “low achievement” and “at risk of Mathematics Learning Difficulties” zones than students in the control group. This suggests that it is possible to develop a scalable {RTI} framework and implement it in educational systems without {RTI}-based policies.},

Here we describe the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its development. The most notable addition has been that Builder interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now launch {PsychoPy} every month, and more than 90 people have contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the project, as well as plans for the future.},
