This is a project to help psychologists and cognition researchers to creat the stimuli for their experiments. 

This is not a production-grade software project, so it prefers simplicity over complete robustness. The code and architecture needs to be excellent, but it can make assumptions on minor things like data types, nulls, etc. 

In short, let's make good code, but without overcomplicating things, and prioritizing simplicity, felixibility, and extendability.
